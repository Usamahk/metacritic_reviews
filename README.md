# metacritic_reviews

Just curious about games, and their reviews. See if I can get a breakdown of genres, platforms etc. The interesting thing about using metacritic is that is that it has reviews aggregated from review sites as well as user scores. So it’s something interesting to look at. I want to look at golden era’s too. Maybe could tie this in with game lengths from “how long to beat”

### Data Process
- Scrape data from metacritic. - not sure if its just reviews or if we're doing it by genre as well..
